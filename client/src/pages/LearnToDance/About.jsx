Whether you&apos;re preparing for a special event, want to feel comfortable dancing in social settings, or are just looking to try something new, I&apos;m here to guide you.

        <Text fontSize="lg" mb={4}>
          In social dance, the emphasis is on enjoying the music and your partner&apos;s company, not perfecting every move. I&apos;ll teach you how to lead or follow comfortably, how to move naturally with the music, and how to adapt to different partners and styles. Whether you&apos;re new to dance or looking to brush up on your skills, I&apos;ll help you develop a strong foundation, so you can confidently step out onto any dance floor!
